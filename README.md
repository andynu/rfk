# RFK

A jukebox that plays random songs. (for now)

**This is a toy project as I learn go.**

## Building

A few assumptions:

* You're running linux, or a POSIX compatible shell.
* You've cloned this repository to ~/rfk


### Install go
You'll need go. See https://golang.org/dl/
https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

    cd
    wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz    
    tar xvfz go1.5.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

Setting up your go env for this project:

    export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
    export GOPATH=~/go:~/rfk

### Install mpg123

For the moment only files that mpg123 can play are supported. mpg123 is expected to be in your path.

    sudo apt-get install mpg123

or download it from http://www.mpg123.de/

### Configure your music library

RFK knows about your music from a songs.txt file that contains absolute paths paths to your song files (one per line).

    mkdir -p ~/rfk/data/$(hostname)/
    find / -name '*.mp3' > ~/rfk/data/$(hostname)/songs.txt

### Building & Running

    cd ~/rfk
    go build rfk
    ./rfk

You should now be listening to random music.
